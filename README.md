# Distracted-Driver-using-Deep-Neural-Networks
Real time driver distraction using state farm dataset
In this notebook, I'll use the dataset which includes images of drivers while performing a number of tasks including drinking, texting etc. The aim is to correctly identify if the driver is distracted from driving. We might also like to check what activity the person is performing.

The notebook will be borken into the following steps:

1. Import the Libraries.
2. Import the Datasets.
3. Create a vanilla CNN model.
4. Create a vanilla CNN model with data augmentation.
5. Train a CNN with Transfer Learning (VGG16).
6. Results.

Import the Libraries
I'll use Keras and Tensorflow libraries to create a Convolutional Neural Network. So, I'll import the necessary libraries to do the same.
